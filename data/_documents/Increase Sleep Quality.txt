Sleep is crucial for mental and physical well being. It is when the mind reconsolidates and clears. It is when the body grows and adapts. There are many actions that can be taken to improve sleep quality.
Consistency
Sleeping and waking up at the same time can drastically improve sleep quality. It conditions the body to start up and shut down at the same time during the day, meaning falling asleep at the designated time will become easy. 
Light Exposure
During the day, more bright light exposure can help the body wake up and spend more energy in the day, further strengthening the circadian rhythm. Spending more energy in the daytime will directly correlate to having better sleep at night. Conversely, blue light should be avoided in the evening and onward. It sends a message to the body that it is still daytime and results in the body not being ready to rest when bedtime comes.
Exercise
Physical activity is a great tool for increasing sleep quality. Exercise increases the release of hormones like epinephrine and adrenaline, which can exhaust the body, leading to better sleep at night. However, exercising closer to the evening actually has the opposite effect. It reduces sleep quality.
Clear the Mind
Meditation can be very powerful before bed. It can clear the mind and reduce anxiety, leading to a more smooth and swift experience as you fall asleep. Other techniques that help are:
- Listening to music
- Mindfulness
- Deep breathing
- Reading
Consumption
As the evening approaches, it is best to avoid consuming a lot of food or drinking a lot of liquids. Food may cause the body to increase energy output, which is not desired in the evening. Too much water at night is also proven to disrupt sleep.
