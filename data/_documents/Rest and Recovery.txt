While there is much focus on when the athlete is working, there must also be focus on when the athlete is resting. Rest and recovery play a big role in how quickly the athlete adapts to training stimulus, it is when most adaptations actually occur. There are three pillars to rest and recovery:
- Sleep
- Nutrition
- Active Recovery
Sleep
Athletes should be getting an adequate amount of sleep during resting periods. It is the most important part of rest and recovery. While a good amount of sleep may vary from athlete to athlete, 8-9 hours is generally a good starting point. There are many other ways to increase sleep quality
Nutrition
Proper nutrition is needed for good recovery. It is an essential element of the rebuilding process that your body goes through after a workout. A balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates, and fats is ideal, which small differences between different athletes. Protein is essential for muscle growth and general recovery. Carbohhydrates are needed for storing energy in the form of glycogen, which will fuel the body for the next workout. Fats help create long term energy stores for the body and help other vitamins and nutrients better heal the body. A nutrition plan can be a useful tool.
Active Recovery
Although active recovery is the least important part of rest and recovery, it can still help athletes a lot, and can even increase performance. Stretching is a popular form of active recovery. It is done before and after workouts, on rest days, and even as part of workouts sometimes. Stretching enhances muscle recovery, and increases blood circulation to different parts of the body, which can really help an athlete recover. In the long term, it also improves flexibility and mobility, decreasing the chances of injury. Meditating can also be a useful activity in recovery, even though it isn't physical, as it reduces stress and helps the mind work through recent events. Meditation clears the mind and allows better sleep and less anxiety.
