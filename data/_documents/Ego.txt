- Ego represents the sense of self
- It is a tool for the mind to protect itself
- How it works:
	- When negative emotions are incoming, the ego activates
	- The ego either puts other people down or pumps itself up
	- This make the person feel less negative because they are comparatively "better"
- A common example of where ego might show up is in social hierarchies
	- These types of relationships are comparative by nature, which spawns ego
- "As long as you have an ego you will not have sustained happiness"
	- Expectation: fixing the things you are unhappy about will get rid of the unhappiness
	- Reality: Unhappiness is present when the default mode network is active
		- Thinking about yourself causes unhappiness
- The best ways to maintain a healthy ego are
	- To compare yourself less
	- To spend time in nature
	- To meditate
