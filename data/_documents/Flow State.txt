Flow is a state where one is completely immersed in the activity that they are in. It is a highly subjective topic as it cannot be easily measured and is different for everybody. Here are some characteristics of flow state:
- Complete focus and immersion in activity
- Loss of self consciousness or ego
- Loss of temporal awareness
- High levels of success in activity
- Heightened intuition

How Flow State is Achieved
There are many ways to encourage a state of flow. It is impossible to purposely get into a state of flow, just like how it is impossible to put yourself in a state of sleep. Firstly, the difficulty of the task at hand must match or slightly exceed the capabilities of the person doing it. If the task is too easy, the person will not be engaged and will fall into boredom. On the other hand, if the task is too hard, the person will spiral into anxiety and won't be able to calm the mind and focus. Another key to experiencing flow is to cut out distractions. Distractions won't let the mind focus and will constantly pull you out of flow once you are in it. Another activity that encourages flow is meditation. It calms the mind and removes distracting thoughts and impulses. The most important thing that needs to be present for flow to occur is passion/purpose. If someone doesn't like what their doing, they will have a hard time finding a state of flow without looking for external motivation.
