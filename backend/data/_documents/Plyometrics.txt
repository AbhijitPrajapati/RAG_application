Plyometrics are quick movements that require muscles to exert as much force as possible in a short amount of time. These are meant to improve rate of force development and transfer strength to power/speed. There are intensive and extensive plyometrics. Intensive plyometrics focus on maximum intensity and yield a high force output in a very short amount of time, like in broad jumps and box jumps. They are generally more fatiguing, which is where extensive plyometrics come in. Extensive plyometrics are meant to be less fatiguing, making them more accessible throughout a training cycle. These include repeated hops, bounds, and jump rope.

How to Program Plyometrics
At the beginning of a program, where the athlete is supposed to develop a base level of strength, mobility, and stability, plyometrics are used to build tendon strength and teach the body how to handle forces and put them back out, so as to not get injured in the later phases of training. Favorable plyometrics in this stage of the program include hops, low box jumps, and bounding.

In the middle of the program, some intensive plyometrics can start to be introduced as strength-speed becomes the main training goal. Plyometrics in this phase of training are still not the main exercises, but are used more frequently in order to encourage higher rate of force production along with tendon stiffness. Extensive plyometrics are still used. Power

Near the end of the program, intensive plyometrics become one of the main movements that athletes use to allow them to use all of the strength and power built up from before in order to make speed-strength gains. This is usually the area of the force velocity curve that plyometrics best target which is why many intensive plyometrics should be used in this phase of training such as box jumps, depth jumps, and max vertical jumps.
