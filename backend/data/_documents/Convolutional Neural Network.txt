Convolution Operation
- Sliding square kernels across the image and replacing the corresponding pixels in the feature map with the dot product of the kernel and the pixels in the original image
- The kernels are learned parameters
- Padding is often used around the image before convolution
	- Same padding adds (f-1) / 2  layers of zeros to each side of the image, where f is the kernel size. This makes it so that the image dimensions are preserved after the convolution.
	- Full padding makes it so that every pixel gets to be the center of the kernel at least once by adding $f-1$ layers of zeroes to each side, where f is the kernel size. This increases the image dimensions.
	- Reflective padding reflects the pixel values of the image across the edge into the padding.
	- If the padding values end up being fractional because of the kernel size, the padding is asymmetrical
- Stride is the amount of pixels that a kernel moves after each dot product
- Extra padding may be added to avoid pixels being left out due to stride size
- When there are multiple channels in the input image, a different kernel is used for each channel, but the outputs of each kernel are summed.
Max Pooling
- Slides a kernel over the image and take the max value to be set as the corresponding pixel value in the output image
-  Stride is the amount of pixels that a kernel moves after each operation
- If the window does not capture all of the pixels due to the stride, then those pixels will be left out
