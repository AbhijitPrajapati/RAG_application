Core Mindset
Essentialism relies on three main truths:
- Individual choice: people can choose how they spend their time
- Acknowledgment of noise: most things are not useful, which makes finding the few that are useful is important
- Acceptation of trade-offs: nobody can "do it all", so trade-offs have to be made to prioritize what matters
Essentialists should look for what they can do to produce the most results most efficiently, and invest in those opportunities instead of the other noise that is there. Trade-offs will have to be made between different things and it is important to see what is the most essential and what isn't.
Takeaways
- Explore more before finding what they will focus in on so that they can be assured that they made the right choice
- Give yourself enough time and space to ponder and conceptualize what is essential and what isn't
- Notice abnormal details to find the real essence of the task at hand
- Play, or doing something just for the enjoyment of it instead of its outcome, is an essential activity and fuels brain plasticity, creativity, and adaptability
- Sleep is extremely important for regular function. In the trade off of sleep and results, sleep always wins 
- "If it isn't a definite yes, it's a no" should be applied to all decisions
- The 90 percent rule means that anything that doesn't score at least a 90 percent in the most important criteria should be taken out
- Even when easy opportunities appear, that might not directly work towards the main goal and aspiration, they should be pushed to the side and not prioritized due to fear of missing out.
- Find one thing to specialize in and do just that one thing.
- Look for the best opportunity instead of a lot of good opportunities.
- "If I didn't have this opportunity, what would I do to get it?" is a great question to ask when struggling to cut out a commitment that should be cut out.
- Cutting out activities that don't contribute to the long term goal is a good place to start
- A sense of purpose is needed to be motivated, and that sense of purpose needs to be really clear
- Prioritizing everything means prioritizing nothing.
- A good way to find a clear sense of purpose is to look for something both inspirational and concrete. This essential intent eliminates a plethora of other options and helps restrict the viewpoint to just the few essential idea and opportunities. The essential intent also needs to be measurable and simple.
- Having the courage to say no can greatly benefit focus on what is essential. It is not enough to just know what is and isn't essential.
- It's important to not give into the social pressure to say yes to non-essential things.
- Saying no may have initial downsides, but it increases respect in the long-term
- Saying no gracefully is a skill to be learned
- Its important not to fall into the sunk-cost fallacy, and to cut losses immediately if it isn't working out.
- Always pause for some time before speaking
- Make sure every commitment actively contributes towards overarching goals
- Sometimes just observing and gathering insight is better than trying to provide further input
- Even just one exception to a boundary will break the boundary and make life unorganized.
- Instead of relying on willpower to execute what is essential, create systems where non-essentials are removed so that staying disciplined is easy.
- The time for commitments expands to fill the time that it is given, which means that a buffer should be enforced.
- Prepare as early as possible and finish things as soon as possible without sacrificing quality
- Always think about what would happen if the worst-case scenario happened.
- Improving the weakest link in the chain will yield the best results. Focus on the main obstacle. 
- Start with small steps to gradually build up a big outcome
- Do the minimum amount as early as possible for any task with a deadline
- Routine is powerful
- Use already established routine items to remind yourself about new habits
-  Freeing up the mind and saving mental energy leads to increased cognitive performance and creativity
- Do the hardest things first
- Mix up routines to avoid boredom
- Implement new habits one by one
- Focus on what is important in the current moment, and be present
- Don't try to concentrate on more than one thing at once
