The force velocity curve highlights different types of stimulus presented in athletic training. At the very top, where the velocity is as little as possible and the force output is a much as possible, is max strength. This is often the base of many programs and builds basic strength that is required to develop other adaptations.

Strength-speed is strength but with more velocity and less force. It bridges the gap between strength and power. Example exercises include:
- Power Cleans
- Explosive Squat

Power is where speed meets strength. It is important for many sports and is the turning point of the force-velocity curve, where many of the adaptations become directly useful in sports, not just for building other adaptations. Power is describes as producing as much force in as little time as possible. Some plyometrics like box jumps are found here.

Speed-strength bridges the gap between power and speed. It isn't just moving as fast as possible, but it aims to quicken the development of force acquired in power. This is where most plyometrics are focused. 

Speed is when movements are being done as fast as possible, with not much focus on force. It is the main goal for sports like track, whereas power may also be desired in basketball. To achieve progress in this adaption, the adaptations that come before it on the curve need to be trained in order. If you can't produce 300 pounds of force you can't produce 300 pounds of force in 0.2 seconds
