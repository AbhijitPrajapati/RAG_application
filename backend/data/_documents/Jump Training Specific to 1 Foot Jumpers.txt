While the base of athletic training and jump training still apply to both one and two foot jumpers, there are still many differences that can help accelerate progress for one foot jumpers.

| Attributes                     | Two Foot Jumper     | One Foot Jumper           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Range of Motion                | Deeper (Half squat) | Shallower (Quarter Squat) |
| Ground Contact Times           | ~0.2 seconds        | 0.17-0.18 seconds         |
| [[Force Velocity Curve]] Focus | Closer to power     | Closer to speed           |
| Body Composition               | Muscular, Stockier  | Lanky, Long-limbed        |

Since one foot jumpers have a more shallow range of motion, they will benefit from doing quarter squats more than two foot jumpers. However, starting a program with full ROM squats is still useful to build general strength needed to make the most of quarter squats.

Because of the shorter ground contact times, plyometrics will be more useful for one foot jumpers, particularly unilateral ones (to cater to the unilateral nature of one foot jumping). Non-unilateral plyometrics should still be included.

Sprint training will also be heavily beneficial for one foot jumpers due to the emphasis on speed rather than power. 

In terms of strength exercises, posterior chain exercises are the best at supporting the needs of one foot jumpers, who use more of their posterior chain than two foot jumpers.

In conclusion, the best exercises for one foot jumpers are:
- Deadlift
- Hip Thrust
- RDL
- Hang Cleans
- Sprinting
- Single Leg Bounding
- Single Leg Hops
- Half Squats
